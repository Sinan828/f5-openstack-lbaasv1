## Build
### Debian Packages
In order to build debian packages use Docker/debian/Dockerfile to create a container that has the necessary prerequisites installed
to create a package for the Trusty Ubuntu disto.

```
$ docker build -t deb-pkg-builder ./Docker/debian
```
Then package the driver, agent, and common code by executing:

```
$ docker run -v "$PWD:/var/build" deb-pkg-builder /bin/bash /build-debs.sh
```
The debs are in the following directories:

./agent/deb_dist
./common/deb_dist
./driver/deb_dist

### RPM Packages
In order to build RPMs use Docker/redhad/Dockerfile to create a container that has the necessary prerequisites installed to build
a package for Centos/RedHat 7.

```
$ docker build -t rpm-pkg-builder ./Docker/redhat
```
Then package the driver, agent, and common code by executing:

```
$ docker run -v "$PWD:/var/build" rpm-pkg-builder /bin/bash /build-rpms.sh
```
The rpms are in the following directories:

./agent/dist
./common/dist
./driver/dist

## PyPI
To make a PyPI package...

```
bash
python setup.py sdist
```

## Test
Before you open a pull request, your code must have passing [pytest](http://pytest.org) unit tests. In addition, you should include a set of functional tests written to use a real BIG-IP device for testing. Information on how to run our set of tests is included below.

#### Unit Tests
We use pytest for our unit tests
1. If you haven't already, install the required test packages and the requirements.txt in your virtual environment.
```
shell
$ pip install hacking pytest pytest-cov
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the tests and produce a coverage repor.  The `--cov-report=html` will
create a `htmlcov/` directory that you can view in your browser to see the
missing lines of code.
```
shell
py.test --cov ./icontrol --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

#### Style Checks
We use the hacking module for our style checks (installed as part of
step 1 in the Unit Test section).
```
shell
flake8 ./
```
